### Q3 2024: Foundational Enhancements & Personalization

The focus for this quarter is on transforming the tool from a single-session experience into a personalized platform.

-   **User Accounts & Saved Wardrobes:**
    -   Implement a simple authentication system.
    -   Allow users to save their generated models and custom wardrobe items to their account, enabling persistence across sessions.

-   **Style History & Saved Outfits:**
    -   Develop a system for users to save a complete styled outfit (model + all garments).
    -   Create a "My Styles" gallery where users can view, name, and manage their saved looks.

-   **Accessory Try-On:**
    -   Introduce a new "Accessory" category in the wardrobe.
    -   Enhance the AI prompt to realistically place items like hats, sunglasses, and necklaces on the model.

### Q4 2024: Social, Sharing, and E-commerce Integration

This quarter is focused on making the application more interactive and connecting it to the real world.

-   **Outfit Sharing:**
    -   Generate a clean, shareable image of the final styled outfit, perfect for social media.
    -   Include a subtle watermark or link back to the application.

-   **"Shop the Look" Integration:**
    -   Use the Gemini API to analyze a styled outfit (e.g., "blue denim jacket and black jeans").
    -   Perform a grounded search to find and display links to similar, real-world products from e-commerce websites.

-   **Color & Pattern Variation Tool:**
    -   Add a new AI tool that allows users to select a garment on the model and request variations (e.g., "make this dress green," "add a floral pattern to this shirt").

---

### Q1 2025: Advanced AI & Creative Expansion

The focus shifts to pushing the boundaries of generative AI and offering more powerful creative tools.

-   **Generative Backgrounds:**
    -   Allow users to replace the neutral studio background with a fully generated scene from a text prompt (e.g., "at a cafe in Paris," "on a beach at sunset").

-   **Animated Try-On (Experimental):**
    -   Leverage video-generation models to create short, animated clips of the model making a simple movement (e.g., turning, a subtle pose shift) while wearing the outfit.

-   **Personalized AI Stylist:**
    -   Develop a feature where an AI stylist can recommend outfits based on a user's saved items and a specific occasion (e.g., "create a professional look for a meeting," "style something for a summer party").

### Future Vision: Beyond the Horizon

These are long-term, ambitious goals that could define the next generation of the platform.

-   **Multi-Model Scenes:** Allow users to style and pose multiple models in a single, cohesive scene.
-   **Full 3D Integration:** Move from 2D image generation to creating a 3D model of the user and draping clothes in a 3D environment for a fully interactive experience.
-   **Real-time Video Try-On:** Utilize the device's camera to superimpose virtual garments onto a user in real-time.
