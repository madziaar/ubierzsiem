**Crucial Rules:**
1.  **Garment Placement:** Intelligently place the new garment from the 'garment image' onto the person in the 'model image'. If the new garment is a top (shirt, jacket, etc.), it should replace any existing top. If it's a bottom (pants, skirt), it should replace any existing bottom. The new garment should layer realistically over any existing clothing that would naturally be worn underneath (e.g., a jacket over a shirt).
2.  **Preserve the Model:** The person's face, hair, body shape, and pose from the 'model image' MUST remain unchanged.
3.  **Preserve the Background:** The entire background from the 'model image' MUST be preserved perfectly.
4.  **Master-Level Digital Tailoring (Crucial)::** The final image must be indistinguishable from a real photograph. The garment's fit is paramount.
    *   **Fabric Physics Simulation:** Go beyond a simple drape. Simulate the specific weight, stiffness, and texture of the fabric. Denim should show its characteristic rigidity and seam puckering. Silk should have soft, flowing folds and specular highlights. Cotton should have fine, subtle wrinkles.
    *   **Anatomically Correct Conformance:** The garment must conform to the underlying human form with extreme precision. It should show tension where the fabric is stretched over the body (e.g., shoulders, chest, hips) and compression with realistic folds where the body bends (e.g., inside of elbows, waist).
    *   **Photorealistic Texture and Lighting:** The garment's texture must be perfectly preserved and mapped onto the draped form. Light must interact with this texture realisticallyâ€”creating subtle shadows within the weave of a knit sweater or a sharp sheen on leather. Shadows cast by the body onto the garment, and by the garment's folds onto itself, must be soft, accurate, and perfectly consistent with the single light source of the original 'model image'.
5.  **Safety First:** The final image must be appropriate for a general audience and e-commerce. It must not contain nudity. If a garment is revealing, the person must still be depicted with appropriate coverage (e.g., wearing neutral underwear underneath).
6.  **Output:** Return ONLY the final, edited image. Do not include any text.`;

**Crucial Rules:**
1.  **Accessory Placement:** Intelligently and realistically place the accessory on the person. 
    *   Hats, beanies, or headwear go on the head.
    *   Sunglasses or eyewear go on the face, over the eyes.
    *   Bags or purses should be held in the hand or worn over the shoulder, in a manner that fits the model's pose.
    *   Jewelry (necklaces, earrings) should be placed appropriately.
2.  **ADD, DON'T REPLACE:** The accessory must be ADDED to the person. Do NOT replace any of the existing clothing. Layer the accessory realistically on top of the current outfit.
3.  **Preserve Everything Else:** The person's face, hair, body shape, pose, and all existing clothing from the 'model image' MUST remain unchanged, except where obscured by the new accessory. The background must also be preserved.
4.  **Realism is Key:** The final image must be indistinguishable from a real photograph. The accessory must be scaled correctly and integrated with the scene's lighting, casting soft, accurate shadows on the model and their clothing.
5.  **Safety First:** The final image must be appropriate for a general audience.

2.  **Exclude Accessories & Sub-items:** Do NOT identify accessories such as belts, jewelry, hats, bags, shoes, glasses, or other small items. Do not identify parts of clothing like 'collar', 'sleeve', 'pocket', etc. Only complete, separable garments.
3.  **Handle Single Items:** If the image clearly shows a single, unified item (e.g., a dress, a jumpsuit, a single coat), identify it as one item.
4.  **Handle Multiple Items:** If the image shows a combined outfit consisting of multiple distinct and separable garments (e.g., a shirt and pants, a suit with a jacket and trousers), identify EACH separable item individually.
5.  **Output Format:** Return a JSON array of strings, with each string being the lowercase name of a single identified garment. Ensure there are no duplicates.

**Examples:**
-   An image of a suit -> \`["blazer", "trousers"]\`
-   An image of a t-shirt and jeans -> \`["t-shirt", "jeans"]\`
-   An image of a single red dress -> \`["dress"]\`

-   An image of a shirt with a belt -> \`["shirt"]\` (belt is excluded)
